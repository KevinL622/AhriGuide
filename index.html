          <p>This guide is for those already familiar with Ahri's basic skills and the general flow to a typical game of League of Legends. The information presented is based off patch 8.12. If you are unfamiliar with Ahri's skills, watch this video and come back to the guide. Her skills have been updated since but are conceptually the same. You can also click <a href="http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Ahri" target="_blank">here</a> for up to date information on Ahri.</p>

      <header><h2>Why Play Ahri?</h2></header>
        <p>Ahri has always been a solid pick regardless of the meta. She has crowd control in her E charm, burst in her E-->W+Q combo and mobility in her R. She has one of the best kits in the game which makes her versatile in what roles she can play. She can be an assasin, utility mage or an AOE DPS machine for teamfights.</p>
      <p>Pros</p><ul>
        <li>Great damage for teamfights</li>
        <li>Assasin capability to make picks</li>
        <li>Mobile ultimate skill for iniation and escapes</li>
        <li>Stable mid that's relevant throughout the game</li>
        <li>Decent waveclear</li>
        <li>Effective roam ganker</li>
        <li>Charm crowd control versatile for peeling/escape/focus fire</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Cons</p><ul>
        <li>Can be mana hungry if you don't manage mana well.</li>
        <li>Skill shot dependent, if her skillshots miss she does very little damage.</li>
        <li>Not the easiest champion to learn for beginners.</li>
        <li>Can fall off late game if she is behind.</li>
        <li>Squishy and highly dependent on positioning.</li>
      </ul>

         <h3>Jamal's Standard Ahri Runepage</h3>
      <img class="runepage" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ps3eCRgpj9xIRiD-V4vTypQgO9pIfnMkCaTCtXTWHaW5oIhXgzET9Fe5nLoc1mZnJaqEA_ntAtn9GuRoPmFFAMWHOPUPuwpAT_DvNjdh73PenVm32WvDf6xxgpuI8-4HS5WR1L608g=w2400">
        <p>This is my standard runepage. It's designed for early lane pressure and teamfights. Comet, scorch, and manaflow band will allow you to harass often with your Q every 20 seconds in laning phase. Triumph will get you more gold and heal you in teamfights which is helpful in prolonged battles or small skirmishes. Coup de grace will add a lot of damage to help you get those kills. You will want to focus on early harass and wave management so you can roam a lot. This will be further explained in the Game Phases section.</p>
      <p>Potential Substitutions:<br>
        <ol>
          <li>Transcendence for Absolute focus-   Gives you more CDR in the mid game at the trade off of less AP damage overall.
          </li>
          <li>Cut-down for Coup De Grace- Good for enemy compositions that have a lot of tanks.
          </li>
          <li>Presence of Mind for Triumph- It's up to your playstyle. I like triumph because it keeps me alive longer in prolonged teamfights and gives me more gold. But if you are confident the mana regen and ult cdr from Presence of Mind is more beneficial if you stay healthy during a team fight.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Assasin Ahri Runepage</h3>
      <img class="runepage" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vlVVVrDCpk4LPl6vEduD08ayowvFOv2sj84SeoAzzK5tjf_6_5RZLrbVhupfZzTW-fXU9mJlUUHZANA5LP5fzzAwr3pmwHfyhFnIwOSQC96Kosz-vvs-HnEgzy5AgRP05ePd2-8cng=w2400">
      <p>Electrocute and cheap shot will give you high pre-level 6 combo damage. Eyeball collection will get you more damage for your takedowns. Ultimate hunter will make your R come up a lot more as the game progresses and you get more takedowns. Absolute focus and gathering storm will provide you with more AP for damage. This page centers more around playing safe during laning phase, waiting for jungle ganks, and scaling to mid game for skirmishes. Your job will ultimately to catch people out of position and eliminate them.</p>
<p>Potential Substitutions:<br>
    <ol>
      <li><img class="runeicon" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SqjfhyQ8cyJ-fMclCg_hZFJgj_SoRyvVIZmBX-Jm9nrZGn8GiLKnwt14DqxcMky9o-2DRhpKY8S6JOgWyjFhQLD2BcZJl7bMqQjfa4ZdVzBTVlPM_cky3geMZn1H7LrshRbbnk5sFQ=s87-p-k" alt="sudden impact icon">Sudden Impact for <img class="runeicon" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JE5PoPIrjvlO8iSce92WbBDSbKuh6OpMxCLze94x4wIarOEM6v4i8bHwDP5Z2-EyLg9oVDQjns8GZJ0AlYeHb00J2dFQsp-wp8YzzxdrQbJnD3CY1WnjVRIt7jorevu17PX2uLbVMQ=w2400">Cheap Shot-<br>If you'd rather play safe and wait for lvl 6, then over the long term sudden impact is better than cheap shot.</li>
      <li>Scorch for Gathering Storm-<br>For those who would like more early harrass and damage, scorch is a good additive on to electrocute/cheap shot combo. It has 20 sec cd which can give yousome more harass power when your electrocute is down. If you want to snowball a game scorch is better.</li>
      <li>Transcendence or Mana Flow Band for Absolute Focus-<br>As mentioned before, if you want more cdr by mid game, transcendence is the way to go. Mana Flow Band is good if you have trouble conserving your mana.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Jamal's Standard vs. Assasin Runepage</h3>
    <p>The core comparison here is between Comet and Electrocute. Using the power of Javascript, I can calculate the damage of these runes.</p>
    <h4>Electrocute Damage Calculator Function</h4>
    <code>
function electrocuteDmg (Bonus_Attack_Damage, Ability_Power, Champion_Level) {
    if (Champion_Level &lt 1 || Champion_Level &gt 18) {
        console.log("Invalid Champion Level Entered");
    }
    else {
        var electrocuteDamage = (Champion_Level-1)*10 + 50 +
        (1.5*Bonus_Attack_Damage) + (1.3*Ability_Power);

        var damagePerMinute = (electrocuteDamage*60) /
        (50 - (Champion_Level-1)*(25/17));

        console.log(electrocuteDamage + " electrocute damage");
        console.log(damagePerMinute + " electrocute damage per minute");
    }
}

electrocuteDmg (0, 38, 1);
//Lvl 1 Items for Ahri Doran Ring +15AP, Runepage Bonus +18AP,
//absolute focus +5= 38AP

electrocuteDmg (40, 773, 18);
//full build based off Jamal's Standard Build at lvl 18 + the bonuses of runes
//+24AP 30minuts in gathering storm, +40AP Absolute focus,
//+30AP full eyeball stacks, +18AP initial= 440+112= 552*1.4(for rabadon)= 772.8
    </code>
    <p>The result is:<br>
      <strong>Level 1:</strong><br>
      99.4 electrocute damage<br>
      119.28 electrocute damage per minute<br>
      <strong>Level 18:</strong><br>
      1284.9 electrocute damage<br>
      3083.76 electrocute damage per minute</p>
    <h4>Comet Damage Calculator Function</h4>
    <code>
function cometDmg (Bonus_Attack_Damage, Ability_Power, Champion_Level) {
    if (Champion_Level &lt 1 || Champion_Level &gt 18) {
        console.log("Invalid Champion Level Entered");
    }
    else {
        var cometDamage = (Champion_Level-1)*(70/17) + 30 +
        (1.35*Bonus_Attack_Damage) + (1.2*Ability_Power);

        var damagePerMinute = (cometDamage*60) /
        (20 - (Champion_Level-1)*(12/17));

        var cdrDPM = (cometDamage*60) /
        ((20 - (Champion_Level-1)*(12/17))*.72);

        console.log(cometDamage + " comet damage");

        console.log(damagePerMinute + " comet damage per minute");
        console.log(cdrDPM + " comet damage per minute after ability cdr");
    }
}
cometDmg (0, 34, 1);
//blue tree with yellow tree +14AP, absolute focus +5AP, doran's ring +15AP=34

cometDmg(40, 678, 18);
//Jamal's Standard Build 440AP,lvl 18 absolute focuse +40AP, rune tree +14AP
//=44AP+440AP=484AP *1.4(rabadon)= 677.6AP,
//keep in mind there is also the +15AP from takedowns for 10 sec that I left out
    </code>
    <p>The result is:<br>
      <strong>Lvl 1:</strong><br>70.8 comet damage<br> 212.4 comet damage per minute<br>295 comet damage per minute after ability cdr
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Lvl 18:</strong><br>967.6 comet damage<br>7257 comet damage per minute<br>10079.17 comet damage per minute after ability cdr<br><br>
      <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
      At lvl 1, electrocute out damages comet by around 28 but if you add the scorch on with comet the difference is cut down to 8 damage. Comet still out damages electrocute over time by about 100. Comet is better for lane harassment but isn't as good when it comes to landing that kill burst. This is also leaving out the 1.07 multiplier for Coup de Grace. Basically if you want play all or nothing go electrocute and if you want constant damage go comet. Keep in mind this is assuming the comets hit which often they don't early on when the enemy is more aware of them.<br><br>
      Electrocute route will give you about 100 more AP during late game. The proc will also out damage comet by about 317 damage. This is more relevant when it comes to 100 to 0 killing someone. The caveat is that you need to land your charms and rotations or else you will have severely gimped your damage in a team fight. You also have to be precise in who you target because it takes 25 seconds to reload that electrocute. <br><br>
      You will have way more damage output over time with comet. The 8 sec cooldown at lvl 18 with 10% CDR per aoe skill, and 20% per single target skill, you'll be procing comets about every 5-6 seconds. This is more useful for prolonged team fight situations such as contesting Baron/dragons, sieging/defending towers, or just long fights in general.

      <h3>Skill Order</h3>
      <img class="skillorder" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TdZN8od1HIrf4-S1Zsc11RVgRn-ZJ2LIQx2nhDtdsC1WCpwEs1QhcetdvtiNBEWDSmi_tR5ns9d2Rc9v3DRt1V9SYoz4JIJKgIxIkqGAD9-LjT8vnZzF0cB0xRVbzmHGNsGgDzSrTg=w2400">
      <p>Ahri's skill order is pretty straight forward. Max Priority is R-->Q-->W-->E. Now some might opt to level E when reaching level 8 instead of W. It is your call on if you want the extra 30 damage and .25sec of charm. My personal preference is to max W as soon as possible after Q to maximize burst damage. In general you would lose out on around 24 damage at level 8 but keep in mind you are delaying your W damage at lvl 10 by about 40 damage. There is also an AP scaling bonus difference of 8%, so assuming you have 100AP you would be losing another 8 damage per rotation.<br><br>You can also level W at level 3 instead of getting Q. But I prefer leveling Q at lvl 3. The Q damage is more reliable for harassing early on but W can also be useful for zoning melee champions. Keep in mind if you get W to keep track of your mana.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Summoner Spells</h3>
      <img id="spells" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_RHDiSpY9lN-h6rTLvugFkbT3MIU7sENwRyY6V57_dLYRQ3spbMuuLKAuxldvTfWq3Ik7BY3vZV-Gy0Cw78Cu0QyGN1vii8HJH4ihEbeXv_uLKOqtWxzaTYO5QOmPb_5bmpNeCj0LA=w2400">
      <p>Always go flash and ignite. There's no justifiable reason to go anything else. Ignite is very useful in securing kills, especially first bloods/lane kills. Flash is a given for escape or doing the E--> Flash combo for a hard to dodge charm. Usually by level 4 if you have been harassing well, you can kill the opposing laner.</p>

      <header><h2>Item Builds</h2></header>
      <h3>Starting Items</h3>
      <img id="startingItems" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9AwfrJ5tsYIb5YfizDM471kem9c7Y5dGec64t08bEw2Tf46ijFPx0AhSXCxS8N-rhodmy75M_upy6xkoWNga9KOjXsUtpLn_vfnQ1GxONxyCXScGnzEydBzsluAT9CHLp3jO0CaNmw=w2400">
      <p>Nothing fancy here, <strong>Dorans Ring</strong> and two red pots is the standard. Some may cheese with <strong>Dark Seal</strong> but it's too much of a risk and Ahri needs health.</p>
      <br>

      <h3>First Back Items</h3>
      <img id="firstBackItems" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ztf6RsDenTaQfaaN-RTFfkavpE306i9VMF1LA6RJd7ycXIE2OTh2KvbeoetJwimsv-05iJ8S90j27WoP5MkJsRKEJm37IiurATcjFXyoVjzJuJeAcWj8wHqfebxWZ41nBDkrZQbyA=w2400">
      <p><strong>Lost Chapter</strong> is the most solid buy on the first back. It gives mana, CDR, and AP. This really helps Ahri sustain in lane and her damage output. Afterwards, if you can, buy boots. With any leftover gold always get at least one control ward and some red potions if you need sustain.
        <br><br>
If you are laning against heavy AD such as Zed, Yasuo, or Talon, then getting <strong>Seeker's Armguard</strong> is best.
        <br><br>
If you are agaisnt heavy AP such as LeBlanc or Fizz, getting a <strong>Null-Magic Mantle</strong> can help.</p>
      <br>

      <h3>Core Items</h3>
      <img id="coreItems" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/aZR12VUmE1EOLlWRiNVcT4BXsnu02fSs9JW8IAr7yMRake6vE_X6BCO8xjqFnuFdtt0xotp2V7rE1sogTuqVAWh1F2K0OKRZslwtnQMS7iGT7bECb6wIWMXo8alTRu_XwmdC6py0gw=w2400">
      <p><strong>Luden's Echo</strong> is a must on Ahri. The AOE proc, AP, Mana, and CDR all synergize with Ahri's kit. It also makes her wave clear much easier. Some will argue to get <strong>Morellonomicon</strong> after luden's echo but I found the item to be lackluster unless the enemy team has a ton of healing/regen.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Hextech Gunblade</strong> opens up a huge amount of Ahri's playmaking ability. The range on the slow nuke is very useful for any situation (escape, chasing, assasinating, peeling, setting up charms). The bonus vamp will also help Ahri stay in prolonged fights and make her harder to 1v1.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Sorcerer's Boots</strong> or <strong>Ionian Boots</strong> are up to you. If the enemy team starts building more magic resistance mid-game, get sorcerer's boots. If noone is building MR, get ionian boots for more skill rotations and it is cheaper.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Late Game Items</h3>
      <img id="lateGameItems" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WzAmAit_xQYbqE1lsxttMBVg3_8FRfVTW1YtOjqtcaABLejEkJd4r3iB0qbU22jbOCXGmac2kcLTt987eS_fhZJnK_ZlmL4ppXDUrxgfvmdFdjfybemo_mE3kOjo8G8VtnJ6JDN_Uw=w2400">
      <p><strong>Rabadon's Deathcap</strong> is my go to if the enemy team doesn't stack MR past 100. Pure AP is great on Ahri and makes her deal tons of damage!
        <br><br>
        <strong>Void Staff</strong> is preferrable if the enemy team builds MR past 100. It isn't needed if you can still melt the enemy damage dealers. But if tanks with high MR are tanking too hard then it might be time to get a it.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Morellonomicon</strong> is a good choice if the enemy team has a lot of healing such as Soraka, Dr. Mundo, Darius, Swain, Singed, etc. It is also good for ADC's who build vamp. The extra magic penetration is good for assasinating ADC's.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Rylai's Scepter</strong> synergizes well with cheap shot, if you got it. It's more of a utlity item for peeling/chasing. The extra health is nice and it is more useful when the enemy team has a lot of melee champs that you can kite.
      </p>

      <h3>Situational Items</h3>
      <img id="situational" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GUEB7BEEkXINnWQo31CKDh6PnRv6ZE_aAUjCSGodFH1FbgflO9SIQDBUkZuvRUi2gw0CjZ5XKnA1sADPJV0dRvMli21skdQs0xgQkemlh9QFthNQhSDtiVaIR5mMyxyBAvJ4vTO7EA=w2400">
      <p><strong>Banshee's Veil</strong> or <strong>Abyssal Mask</strong> are good for heavy AP enemy compositions. Sometimes you would want the spell shield for those pesky Veigars or LeBlancs. Abyssal mask would be good also if your own team has a lot of AP damage to help with teamfights.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Zhonya's Hourglass</strong> is needed for Zed matchups. Otherwise don't get it as a first or second item. It can be useful for heavy AD enemy compositions. The active is useful for initiating fights with your ult dash as well as for dire circumstances.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Lich Bane</strong> works great on Ahri in giving her some more consistent damage. You can proc the item with your R wait for 1.5 seconds then proc it again for each of your ult dashes. Usually one proc will be enough for bursting down an enemy, but it can be useful in prolonged teamfights. This is a good buy if you are ahead.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Twin Shadows</strong> is more of a utility item. It can be useful if your support isn't warding and you want to be able to contest objectives. If you already have a good ADC who does lots of damage, then getting this item can be helpful in peeling for your ADC and helping the ADC chase. This item opens up a lot more pick potential. If you see a straggler, use the active and make a pick. Not the worst item to get but it does sacrifice your own burst/damage for more utility.
      </p>

      <h3>Style Points Items</h3>
      <img id="styleItems" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Lpjcv8PvNwUlLwvjLRXvM6Ej8RMHjblv2lVI_tCU3GaqtQRywnsqjfgmWKusP6cGpYt_yKBdQhto8meyMoHaF3CYV46g7zJtDzejGVauCh60d1NQHWXLsS78DgW2uy2ohxhPcDQANg=w2400">
      <p>
        <strong>Spellbinder</strong> works well with Ahri's ult. It gives a ton of AP but I never really found it convenient to buy. I'd rather get a deathcap than this item. If you are going to get it, get it early on when the AP boost is more meaningful. It would probably be a second item buy after luden's.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Hextech GLP-800</strong> is just cool to used with your ult. It's very awkward to buy because luden's is so much better. But if you feel like showing off and spraying ice with your ult then this is for you.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Hextech Protobelt-01</strong> gives Ahri another dash. It actually isn't bad and provides some good extra burst and health. It falls off late game, so get it early as a first or second item if you want to style on your opponents. The extra dash is really over kill which is why Ahri doesn't really need this item, she needs lots of AP.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Liandry's Torment</strong> is a terrible item on Ahri. She is not meant to fight for a long duration. Ahri weaves in and out of fights. But if you already have a rylais and the enemy team is building pure health, this can be a cool buy. Plus it makes your charms more satisfying to hit. But seriously don't buy this on Ahri.
      </p>
      <h3>Typical Final Builds</h3>
      <h4>Standard</h4>
      <img class="finalBuild" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/QA-e_Ue2IB__vjvf3HD5X_H8ON1lJmNURx2yiz3Bk57jCjVBfMxV7duQenxvNfEht9dwlbTPJfotus4WVkwZvcz2-WVEIUW7dMEaD5lWsGTKx9KTIJFcTGF2dZT9KpTKq2Do5UNuBw=w2400">
      <p>This is my standard build. You can choose either lucidity or sorcerer's boots. I would prefer lucidity just because it is cheaper and gives me the full 40% CDR. Positioning is key for this build because you are very squishy but deal tons of damage.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Agaisnt Heavy AD</h4>
      <img class="finalBuild" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3B47hSw_IpKM8wwLEq2oNGUhMDk-JLS1W2_SUJu59U6Fs2DE2XoSle2KGIE_QNP8gMTkLyjrDwv_vVUKVgQXgcqnI6z3Gv2OKaC3cjPrIaRzRw7rddhZL9k4qdTXaSDQguaGJVs5yQ=w2400">
      <p>If you are agaisnt a Zed you can complete the zhonyas first or second. With this build you can be a little more on the front lines to create a distraction then zhonyas. Keep in mind that you can build void staff third or fourth if the enemy team is stacking MR.</p>
      <h4>Against Heavy AP</h4>
      <img class="finalBuild" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/b830rq0F7KWHWHtIgcZdUzZn1n-PuHsbfTjxKPejNvYvLLTJOXQMdupYS7GWzcu4u3vtlNd_b9TZ7h7wxTddTc_O759cE0VgmWZQkj_hNL2XII7jBbA4MgyQTh7BEISPtkj7XBDxaQ=w2400">
      <p>If you are agaisnt LeBlanc or Fizz you can get the banshees first but make sure you get a lost chapter before completing the banshees or you will be mana hungry.</p>
      <h4>Pure Utility</h4>

      <p>If you are behind and rest of your team does plenty of damage, you can opt for the third item twin shadows for some utility. Your main job would be to peel for your ADC and be as annoying as possible. Use the twin shadows to scout/chase/peel. You will rarely go this type of build but sometimes it can be the faster route.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Further Analysis</h3>
      <p>With the power of Javascript, I have generated a summation of each build's stats.</p>
      <h4>Assigning Stat Values of Items Into Arrays</h4>
      <p>First I wrote all the relevant item's stat properties into an array.</p>
        <code>/*Notation for items.
item=[AP, AD, Mana, CDR, Magic Penetration, Health, Armor, MR, Cost]*/

var Rylai = [90, 0, 0, 0, 0, 300, 0, 0, 2600];
//abilities slow for 20% for 1 second

var Zhonya = [75, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 45, 0, 2900];
//2.5 second stasis active cd 120 seconds

var Lichbane = [80, 0, 250, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3200];
//+7% ms and +75AD+50%AP on hit cd 1.5 seconds

var Luden = [90, 0, 600, 20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3200];
//Aoe proc 100+10%AP

var Rabadon = [120, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3600];
//+40% more AP

var Gunblade = [80, 40, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3400];
//active nuke((175-253)+30%ap)

var Morello = [80, 0, 0, 0, 15, 300, 0, 0, 3000];
//grievous wounds for 3 sec

var Voidstaff = [70, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2650];
// ignores 40% MR

var Abyssal = [0, 0, 300, 10, 0, 350, 0, 0, 3000];
//+15% bonus magic damage aura

var Banshee = [75, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 60, 3000];
//spell shield every 40 sec out of combat

var Spellbinder = [120, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2900];
//+10%ms and 0-80 bonus AP for 4 seconds active cd 60 seconds

var Twinshadows = [70, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2400];
//+7%ms and 4000 range ghosts slow 40% for 2-5 seconds cd 90 seconds</code>

  <h4>Writing an Item Stat Summation Function</h4>
  <p>Once the values where stored for each item in an array, I wrote a function to add the values of each corresponding indices for the arrays. This adds up the specific stats of each item to a total. Then I input the typical builds into the function.</p>
      <code>function sumItems(item1, item2, item3, item4, item5) {
    var sum = [];
    for (var i=0; i &lt item1.length; i++){
        sum.push(item1[i] + item2[i] + item3[i] + item4[i] + item5[i]);
    }
    return sum;
};

var standardBuild = sumItems(Luden,Gunblade, Rabadon, Voidstaff, Lichbane);
var ADBuild = sumItems(Luden, Gunblade, Zhonya, Rabadon, Voidstaff);
var APBuild = sumItems(Luden, Gunblade, Banshee, Rabadon, Voidstaff);
var utilityBuild = sumItems(Luden, Gunblade, Twinshadows, Rylai, Rabadon);
var popularBuild = sumItems(Luden, Morello, Rabadon, Zhonya, Voidstaff);
     </code>

  <h4>Writing a Function to Label and Display the Stat Summations</h4>
  <p>For clarity purposes, I wrote another function to print the values of the items with the proper stat label. I then assigned the result to variables.</p>
  <code>function itemStats(item) {
    console.log(item[0] + ' AP,',
    item[1] + ' AD,',
    item[2] + ' Mana,',
    item[3] + ' CDR,',
    item[4] + ' Magic Penetration,',
    item[5] + ' Health,',
    item[6] + ' Armor,',
    item[7] + ' MR,',
    item[8] + ' Gold');
};

var standardStats = itemStats(standardBuild);
var ADStats = itemStats(ADBuild);
var APStats = itemStats(APBuild);
var utilityStats = itemStats(utilityBuild);
var popularStats = itemStats(popularBuild);

console.log(standardStats);
console.log(ADStats);
console.log(APStats);
console.log(utilityStats);
console.log(popularBuild);</code>
      <br>

      <h4>Results</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Jamal's Standard:</strong><br>(Luden's Echo, Hextech Gunblade, Rabadon's Deathcap, Void Staff, Lich Bane)<br>440 AP, 40 AD, 850 Mana, 30 CDR, 0 Magic Penetration, 0 Health, 0 Armor, 0 MR, 16050 Gold<br><br>

        <strong>Agaisnt Heavy AD:</strong><br>(Luden's Echo, Hextech Gunblade, Zhonya's Hourglass, Rabadon's Deathcap, Void Staff)<br>435 AP, 40 AD, 600 Mana, 30 CDR, 0 Magic Penetration, 0 Health, 45 Armor, 0 MR, 15750 Gold<br><br>

        <strong>Agaisnt Heavy AP:</strong><br>(Luden's Echo, Hextech Gunblade, Banshee's Veil, Rabadon's Deathcap, Void Staff)<br>435 AP, 40 AD, 600 Mana, 30 CDR, 0 Magic Penetration, 0 Health, 0 Armor, 60 MR, 15850 Gold<br><br>

        <strong>Pure Utility:</strong><br>(Luden's echo, Hextech Gunblade, Twin Shadows, Rylai's Scepter, Rabadon's Deathcap)<br>450 AP, 40 AD, 600 Mana, 30 CDR, 0 Magic Penetration, 300 Health, 0 Armor, 0 MR, 15200 Gold<br><br>

        <strong>Most Popular Build:</strong><br>(Luden's Echo, Morellonomicon, Rabadon's Deathcap, Zhonya's Hourglass, Void Staff):<br>435 AP, 0 AD, 600 Mana, 30 CDR, 15 Magic Penetration, 300 Health, 45 Armor, 0 MR, 15350 Gold<br><br>
        Keep in mind that even though pure utility is the cheapest and yields the most AP, it doesn't include a Void Staff and will not have the 40% MR ignored in damage.

    <section class="main-section" id="Game_Phases">
      <header><h2>Game Phases</h2></header>
      <h3>1. Laning Phase</h3>
      <p>Laning phase is pretty straight forward. Go to the mid lane and drop a yellow trinket ward near the bottom jungle entrance to prevent lvl 1 invades. Wait for creeps to spawn and start CSing while trying to harass and deny your opponent CS. Help your jungler in river or the jungle if necessary. Push in the mid lane and see if you can roam bottom at lvl 4 and 6. It is important to keep an eye on the mini-map to see if your jungler needs help, if the enemy jungler has shown, for potential ganks bottom or if there are any missing enemies.</p>

      <h4>Harass/Denying Creeps</h4>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QnyGxB4paDo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Your goal is to harass your opponent with Q when they try to get CS. They will have to decide to either get hit by the Q or miss the minion. Often it is easy to get a fadeaway Q because the enemy thinks you are backing off and aren't expecting a Q to fly out. Try to land the Q on the tip so the true damage is applied. This is much easier to do if you went my standard runepage. If you went the assasin runepage then you just want to hold out in lane and keep your distance. If you ever get a good look to charm, go for it but don't throw out charms willy nilly or you will be out of mana fast. Try to have at least half your mana bar full in case you ever need to do a full rotation of E-->W/Q+auto attack.</p>

      <h4>Help Your Jungler</h4>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdVtyA9enbc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>When you are laning, keep your eyes on the jungle and river. If a fight breaks out, go help your jungler. In this clip, I was rewarded handsomely for responding with 3 kills and a double buff. Notice that when fighting, I don't stand still and continually cycle between attacking and moving. Always try to put space between yourself and the opponent. Ahri is ranged squishy champion and standing still only helps melee champions kill her faster.</p>
      <h4>Roaming</h4>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bs-mcPmysQA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>After every creep wave, you want to constantly monitor if you can roam to bottom. In this clip, I saw that TF went back to base which gives me the opportunity to push the lane to tower and roam bottom for a kill and opening up dragon for the taking. You can roam top as well, but bottom lane has more priority because of dragons and support and ADC are two players instead of one top lane. This is a habit you want to form when playing Ahri.</p>
      <br>

      <h3>2. Mid Game</h3>
      <p>You want to either continue to pressure mid lane and take the tower or snowball your bottom lane. Also keep track of the dragons to make sure you are ready to go to dragon pit to secure the objective. You want to either be where the skirmishes are or pressuring mid lane towers. Keep your eyes on the mini-map so you know when you can pressure the lane and when you can roam. Dragons and rift herald are the main priority for mid game.
        <br>
        <br>
        Also you want to switch your trinket to a sweeper so you can start clearing wards, especially if you have the eyeball collector in your runepage. It is also to set up a trap bush by sweeping a bush you know the enmy will go to and waiting there to make a pick. Making picks so you can get objectives are a key way to snowball the game.</p>
      <br>

      <h3>3. Late Game</h3>
      <p>Late game is mostly about objective control around Baron and playing teamfights right. Don't solo farm a lot. If a lane needs to be cleared, clear it quickly and don't overstay. You should be staying near the ADC to peel or be looking for potential picks in the jungle.</p>
      <h4>Make Picks</h4>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5efVnozOHs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p> As you can see from the video, during late game you want to make picks. Denying the enemy jungle vision and waiting for the support to come ward is an easy way to get picks.</p>

      <p>At the start of a fight you want to stay back and let your tanks be the front line. Try to stay near your adc to peel. If the tide of the battle turns, you can become more aggressive and go in with your R. If the enemy starts to target you, back up until they stop going for you then go back in to poke more. If the battle is won you can chase the stragglers down. Try to aim for the enemy damage dealers first. The key concept for Ahri in team fights is to weave in and out of the battle constantly monitoring when to go in and when to back up.</p>
